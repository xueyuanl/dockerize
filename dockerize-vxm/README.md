## dockerize your local vxm
This project could help to deploy the vxm on your dev vm with docker.

The script `localize_vxm.sh` back up your entire database, copy some necessary files from remote vxm and apply git patch on your dev code to prepare for the dockerization.

Run the script with -i (--interactive), it will prompt you to enter the vxm ip address, password and workspace path(or by default). Or use ip and password as parameters.
```sh
sudo ./localize-vxm -i
# or
sudo sh localize_vxm.sh -a vxm_ip_address -p vxm_root_password
```

The localize_vxm.sh has implied some patch on your dev code, so make sure to `make` your project or just build the artifact in mystic.manager.web:war explode
Then use the `docker-compse` to build up the env and DONE.
```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` for your project.

## some issues
If hit some errors about clock or something like that, try to sync your local time with vxm manually. 
```sh
date -s "vxm-date"
sudo timedatectl set-timezone "vxm-timezone"
```
